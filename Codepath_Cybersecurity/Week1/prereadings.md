## Fundamental Security Principles

basis for all security defenses

1. Never trust users
   - determining identity with certainty is difficult
     - who not to trust
       - Hackers
       - stolen laptops
       - stolen passwords
       - former employees
       - unhappy employees
       - contractors
         - need access to system but not as fully-vetted as employees, important to monitor usage and expire access
   - impossible to predict how someone will act in the future
   - needs to treat every login with suspicion
   - dont send emails secure information
   - dont print out secure info - get lost and misplaced
   - do not trust users
2. Least Privilege
   - grant access to systems, data, and physical spaces judiciously, don't grant access to everyone, don't automatically grant a single user access to everything
