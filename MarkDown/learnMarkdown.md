#### Formatting paragraphs(Soft breaks)

line one is very interesting  
you just add two spaces at the end of each line  
and you will get a paragraphs that break  
at each line
`this is code` //for one line

``` c++
this is for paragraphs  
you can add many lines in this block
string yes = "learn";
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++){
  std::cout << yes;
}
```
